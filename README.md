# Modifying #
Build scripts are written for Powershell 4 on Windows. Probably work with PS3, not really sure about PS2. PS4 is the preferred target.

The scripts have dependencies on the following programs:

* Lilypond - http://www.lilypond.org/
* ImageMagick - http://www.imagemagick.org/

Converting the PS scripts to bash or ksh for linux should be trivial.
